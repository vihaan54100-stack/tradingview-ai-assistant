ICON FILES NEEDED
=================

This extension requires icon files in the following sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

RECOMMENDED DESIGN:
- Use a gradient background (purple/blue theme: #667eea to #764ba2)
- Include a chart/trading symbol (like an upward trending arrow or candlestick)
- Add "AI" text or robot icon to indicate AI functionality
- Use white/light colors for symbols on the gradient background

QUICK SOLUTION:
You can use the icon128.svg file as a reference and convert it to PNG files using:
1. Online tools like https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
2. Design tools like Figma, Canva, or Adobe Illustrator
3. Or simply use colored squares with "ðŸ“ˆ" emoji as placeholder

TEMPORARY WORKAROUND:
For testing, you can create simple colored PNG files or use any square images 
in these sizes. The extension will work without perfect icons.
